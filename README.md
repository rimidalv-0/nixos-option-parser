hard to search for options for nixos config, so though i could also learn rust by converting the options search from json to directory hierachy structure to navigate in Obsidian

- home manager:
  found out can set ```manual.json.enable = true``` to get the json manual

- nixos configuration:
  there was a command, forgot what it was, but there is also a way to obtain the json manual, will update here later when found


i aint good in rust by any means, i just play around, to see what does what, so this is more of learn rust rather then usefull tool, still maybe for someone helpfull
